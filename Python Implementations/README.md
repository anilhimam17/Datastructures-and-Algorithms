# Python Implementations

- This sub-repository of the parent Datastructures and Algorithms is focussed on implementing key Datastructures and Algorithms in pure python from scratch.
- The sub-repository is divided into two distinct modules which are as follows:
    - **Linear Structures:** All implementation of linear datastructures (linked lists, stack, queue) are sourced here. Addition complex structures which use linear structures as building blocks (linked list, queue for trees) can also be found here.
    - **Non Linear Structures:** All implementation of non-linear datastructures (btrees, binary search trees, avl trees, heaps and tries) are sourced here.


## Current Status:
- [ ] 🧑‍🔧 Affective immediately the entire codebase is being reviewed and scaffolded for the progress so far.

- 🏗️ Working on improving the codebase of algorithms to contain positively by the end of this month:
    - [ ] Tries
    - [ ] Hashing Algorithms
    - [ ] Search Algorithms
    - [ ] Sorting Algorithms
    - [ ] Graph Algorithms
    - [ ] Greedy Algorithms
    - [ ] Divide and Conquer Algorithms
    - [ ] Dynamic Programming
    - [ ] Backtracking
